# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0] - [2021-05-11]

### Added

- Add MicroEJ SDK tool to deploy an executable file on device using the BSP run script
- Add an option to check if the platform project exists

### Changed

- Execute bash script file (`.sh`) with `/bin/bash`.  This ensure the build and run scripts are properly executed regardless of their file permissions.
- Use placeholders for platform name and platform version in `default.platform` to make it obvious it is generated automatically.

## [1.2.0] - 2021-04-16

### Added

- Add `default.platform` to allow any empty project to be converted as a Platform project (no longer need to import a MicroEJ Architecture first).
- Set default module version to `0.1.0` as other MicroEJ SDK skeletons.
- Set default module organization to `com.mycompany` as other MicroEJ SDK skeletons.
- Use a new private configuration ``embedded`` as the default for the platform dependencies.  This prevents an instance of "Too many loaded Platforms" error in `platform-loader`.

### Fixed

- Fix documentation in `bsp.properties`:

  - The variable `${project.prefix}` is no longer supported.
  - The variables ``*.relative.dir`` are relative to the BSP root directory.

- Fix execution of `run.[bat|sh]` in the directory where is defined `application.out`.
- Fix module configurations for correct Platform module import (especially in a module repository)
- Fix module build crash when no README file is declared (optional)

## [1.1.0] - 2021-01-08

### Changed

 - Added scripts and `module.ivy` file for Platform module build and publication.

## [1.0.0] - 2020-06-24

### Added

  - Initial version with scripts for BSP connection.
