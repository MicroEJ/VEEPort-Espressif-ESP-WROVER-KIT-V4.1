Features
========

Graphical User Interface
------------------------

|PLATFORM| features a graphical user interface.  It includes
a display, one user LED and a runtime PNG decoder.

Display
~~~~~~

The display module drives a 320 x 240 LCD display.  The pixel format
is 16 bits-per-pixel.  The display device is clocked at 60Hz and it is
connected to the MCU via a SPI link, clocked at 80MHz for ST7789V LCP
display and at 33MHz for ILI9341V LCD display.

MicroUI requires a RAM buffer to store the dynamic images data.  A
dynamic image is an image decoded at runtime (PNG image) or an image created
by the MicroEJ application using the ``Image.create(width, height)`` API.
This buffer is located in external RAM.

Leds
~~~~

The board provides an RGB matrix with 3 colored LEDs (red, green ,
blue).  However, only the red LED is available for the user.  The other
two LEDs are using GPIOs multiplexed for other uses.

Network
-------

|PLATFORM| features a network interface with Wi-Fi as an
underlying hardware media.  A limited number of 16 sockets could be
used for TCP connections, 16 for TCP listening (server) connections
and 16 for UDP connections. A DHCP client can be activated to retrieve
a dynamic IP address. All DNS requests can be handled by a MicroEJ
software implementation or a native one.

SSL
-------

|PLATFORM| features a network secure interface. Available
secured protocols are SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2. Supported
keys and certificates formats are PKCS#5 and PKCS#12, PEM or DER
encoded.

File System
-------

|PLATFORM| features a file system interface. An SD card is
used for the storage (previously formated to a FAT32 file system). Up
to 2 files can be opened simultaneously.


Known issues/limitations
========================

- NET LL API cannot change the socket
  send and receive buffer sizes (``LLNET_CHANNEL_IMPL_setOption`` function),
- FS API does not support file
  write/read with offset from/to immortal arrays,
- FS API does not support file backward
  skip,
- IPV6 is not supported,
- |BOARD_NAME| JTAG interface & SD Card interface usage are mutually exclusive. 
  As a consequence, SystemView (which uses the JTAG interface) is enabled only on the Mono-Sandbox Platform. 
  The Multi-Sandbox Platform which requires the FS API which initializes the SDCard interface.
- OTA is enabled only on the Mono-Sandbox Platform. It has been disabled on the Multi-Sandbox Platform in order to fit into the FLASH memory.
- As described in espressif documentation, LCD and microSD cannot be used at
  the same time without unsoldering the resistor R167 (`https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-wrover-kit.html#allocation-of-esp32-pins`).
- On Windows, the toolchain doesn't support long path.  The build
  directory (named ``target~/``) can be moved closer to the root
  filesystem with the ``target`` property.  For example, set
  ``target=C:/tmp/`` in
  ``ESP32-WROVER-Xtensa-FreeRTOS-configuration/module.properties``.
