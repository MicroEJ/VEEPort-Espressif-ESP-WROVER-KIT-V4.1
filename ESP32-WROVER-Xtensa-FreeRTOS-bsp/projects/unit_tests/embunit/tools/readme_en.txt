1.Overview

    This tools generates the test template code for the Embedded Unit.
    The following four tools are distributed.

    tcuppa  : generate test template source file
    bcuppa  : generate the main file, included main()
    tuma    : add a code to the code generated by tcuppa.
    buma    : add a code to the code generated by bcuppa.

    Original tcuppa, bcuppa, tuma, buma is developed by cuppa project.
    It is generate the test template code for the CUnit.
    It can be downloaded from the following URL.

3.Compile

    $ cd <toolsdir>
    $ make


4.Usage

4.1.tcuppa
    The following commands generate the "MyTest.c" file which tests the
    function defined as My.h.
    * It does not mean that the function of My.h is searched automatically.

        $ tcuppa My.h MyTest testXxx testYyy

    The file containing '.' is added to a code as a header file.

4.2.bcuppa
    bcuppa generates the main routine which performs the test generated by
    tcuppa. The following commands generate the "AllTests.c" file which
    performs MyTest.

        $ bcuppa AllTests MyTest

4.3.tuma
    The following commands add a "textZzz" test function to MyTest.

        $ tuma MyTest testZzz

4.4.buma
    The following commands generate "YourTest.c" containing "testXxx" and
    "testYyy" test function.

    	$ tcuppa YourTest testXxx testYyy

	And, then the following commands add the code which performs "YourTest.c" to
	"AllTest.c".
	
    	$ buma AllTests YourTest
