/**
 * @brief This is the definition of the MicroEJ time API.
 * 
 * To implement this API the use of a hardware timer is recommended. The validation is done with the Core Engine Test Suite: https://github.com/MicroEJ/PlatformQualificationTools/tree/master/tests/core
 * 
 * There are 2 types of time in MicroEJ:
 * - The platform time: an arbitrary time that is only relevant to measure elapsed time
 * - The application time: the time elapsed since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC, this time should be set by the MicroEJ application
 * 
 * An implementation example is available on Espressif WROVER: https://github.com/MicroEJ/Platform-Espressif-ESP-WROVER-KIT-V4.1/blob/master/ESP32-WROVER-Xtensa-FreeRTOS-bsp/projects/microej/core/src/microej_time.c
