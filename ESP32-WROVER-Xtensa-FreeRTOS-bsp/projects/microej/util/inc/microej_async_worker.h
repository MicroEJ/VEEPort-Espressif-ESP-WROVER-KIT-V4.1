/**
 * @file
 * @brief Asynchronous Worker API.
 * 		This library helps writing SNI functions that must be executed asynchronously.
 *
 * 		The execution of an SNI function prevents the other Java thread to be scheduled. That's why blocking native functions
 * 		or long native functions should be executed asynchronously.
 * 		<p>
 * 		An async worker is declared statically using the <code>MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_worker_declare()</code> macro and started with
 * 		the <code>MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_initialize()</code> function.
 * 		Jobs are allocated using <code>MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_allocate_job()</code> and scheduled with <code>MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_async_exec()</code>.
 * 		<p>
 * 		Typical usage consists in declaring:
 * 		- for each SNI function, a structure that contains the parameters of the function,
 * 		- an union of all the previously declared structures,
 * 		- the async worker using <code>MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_worker_declare()</code> macro.
 * 		<p>
 * 		For example, if we have to implement asynchronously the following two SNI functions :
 * 		@code
 * 		int foo(int i, int j);
 * 		void bar(int i);
 *		@endcode
 *
 *		<p>
 * 		Then we will declare the async worker as following:
 * 		@code
 *		// foo() parameters structure
 *		typedef struct {
 * 			int i;
 * 			int j;
 * 			int result;
 *		} foo_param_t;
 *
 *		// bar() parameters structure
 *		typedef struct {
 * 			int i;
 *		} bar_param_t;
 *
 *		// union of all the parameters structures
 *		typedef union {
 * 			foo_param_t foo;
 * 			bar_param_t bar;
 * 			...
 *		} my_worker_param_t;
 *
 *		// Declare the worker and the task that will execute it
 *		MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_worker_declare(my_worker, MY_WORKER_JOB_COUNT, my_worker_param_t, MY_WORKER_WAITING_LIST_SIZE);
 *		OSAL_task_stack_declare(my_worker_stack, MY_WORKER_STACK_SIZE);
 *
 *		void initialize(){
 *			MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_status_t status = MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_initialize(&my_worker, "My Worker", my_worker_stack, MY_WORKER_PRIORITY);
 *			if(status != MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_OK){
 *				...
 *			}
 *			...
 *		}
 *
 *		int foo(int i, int j){
 *			MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_job_t* job = MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_allocate_job(&my_worker, (SNI_callback)foo);
 *			if(job != NULL){
 *				foo_param_t* params = (foo_param_t*)job->params;
 *				params->i = i;
 *				params->j = j;
 *
 *				MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_status_t status = MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_async_exec(&my_worker, job, foo_action, (SNI_callback)foo_on_done);
 *				if(status != MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_OK){
 *					// Error
 *					MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_free_job(&my_worker, job);
 *				}
 *			}
 *			// If an error occurred, then an exception is pending,
 *			// otherwise the current thread is suspended.
 *			// In any case, the returned value is not used.
 *			return -1;
 *		}
 *
 *		void foo_action(MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_job_t* job){
 *			foo_param_t* params = (foo_param_t*)job->params;
 *
 *			int i = params->i;
 *			int j = params->j;
 *
 *			...
 *
 *			params->result = result;
 *		}
 *
 *		int foo_on_done(int i, int j){
 *			MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_job_t* job = MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_get_job_done();
 *			foo_param_t* params = (foo_param_t*)job->params;
 *
 *			int result = params->result;
 *			MICROEJ_ASYNC_WORKER_free_job(&my_worker, job);
 *
 *			return result;
 *		}
 *
 *		...
 *		@endcode
